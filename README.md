%lcPower SAS macro to calculate power for longitudinal count and zero-inflated count outcome data

PURPOSE:

The %lcPower macro calculates power for longitudinal correlated count and zero-inflated count outcomes in multi-center studies with randomization stratified by study site. For the longitudinal Poisson and Negative Binomial outcome data the macro lcPower fits generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM). For the longitudinal ZIP and ZINB outcomes the macro lcPower allows users to choose the generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM) or marginal ZIP/ZINB models (Long et al., 2015, Preisser 2016) to fit the data. Then the rejection rate under the alternative hypothesis of true group difference over time will be used to estimate the power of testing the parameter of treatment effect over time (group*time interaction). Corresponding sample size n will be the estimated sample size to reach the power in detecting the treatment effect over time.

REQUIREMENTS:

Base SAS and SAS/STAT software are required.
